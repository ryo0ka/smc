Person
======
- **What are you usually working on?**

WorldPainter
============
- completes its given role,
- "all-around complete bit of software." ‚Üê **what is "all-around"?**

MCEdit
======
- hard to move around in
- the location of the selection gets tricky
- a strong functional program once getting over those

WorldEdit
=========
- very hard to learn, "Wiking is essensial"
- a vast amount of functions
- GUI in-game would be appreciated


Raw comment
===========

1. Tools I use: MCEdit, WorldPainter, WorldEditor
2. WorldPainter I can't complain about; it does what it does very well and is an all-around complete bit of software.<br>
MCEdit can be a bit hard to move around in, and knowing where your selection really is gets a bit tricky on occasion,<br>
but once you get used to using it it's also a very strong functional program.
3. WorldEdit, on the other hand, is pretty hard to learn. I love the vast amount of functionality it has,<br>
but it suffers from you having to wiki it extensively to learn how to use it,<br>
and you have to remember commands and how they interact. It would benefit greatly from a GUI to use in-game.
