Users, Problems and Solutions
================================
- MrOmNom
    - desires enjoyment and minimum extra effort
    - works in a WorldEdit server to get away from  
      tedious effort to install/update MODs and tools
    - dislikes that the server can't stand with large operations
        - weighted-queue system based on operations' load to the server
    - dislikes that the server takes personal requests to push/pull schematics
        - utility to ease the communication (like the Git system)
        - reputation system
    - note: this kind of builders will increase  
      because of the rise of "mega-servers/hubs"  
      and demand for easier/faster methods  
      that bukkit perfectly matches with.
