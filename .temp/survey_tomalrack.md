Raw comment
===========

My main world editing tool is a server running WorldEdit and VoxelSniper.<br>
For my map making I use WorldPainter, and believe it or not I haven't touched MCEdit in months.<br>
As far as functionality goes I love VoxelSniper,<br>
while the commands get a little complicated it is such a powerful tool I can't complain.<br>
Where WorldPainter is concerned I like it, but as a Mac user the interface could be freshened up,<br>
and as an engineer I would like it to be more like a CAD program,<br>
better zooming in and out so things don't just get blurry, hold down middle click to pan,<br>
little things like that. I just wish there was an ignore editor with the simplicity of WorldPainter,<br>
but the functionality of VoxelSniper...

How do you use those tools?
---------------------------
I'm currently in the middle of two builds that I have used these tool on heavily.<br>
The first is a cathedral scaled 1:1 for Minecraft, real original I know,<br>
but it is a replica the the one in the town where my family's ancestors lived.<br>
For this I am using mostly VoxelSniper, not as much WorldPainter.<br>
My other big project it a huge fantasy terrain map styled after the works of J.R.R. Tolkien.<br>
I started with a height map which I imported into WorldPainter, where I smoothed everything out and added biomes.<br>
I then let WorldPainter populate the map with structures and ores.<br>
Now I am working in game to fine tune the terrain and add structures, which I am using VoxelSniper for.<br>
As far as other projects I have a server for myself and friends that<br>
I have been working on for a while now which started as a WorldPainter first attempt<br>
(we have since moved out of the crappy terrain I first painted, it was the early days)<br>
and I have slowly been improving with VoxelSniper. Beyond that I use VoxelSniper a lot in everyday builds,<br>
for instance the no physics brush allows for some seriously interesting stuff,<br>
another plugin I use the WeatherMan which allows me to change biomes in game on the fly,<br>
which is really helpful for terrain editing.<br>
Overall I focus more on terrain with tools like VoxelSniper and WorldPainter,<br>
and do a lot of my structures by hand, unless they are really large and/or repetitive.
