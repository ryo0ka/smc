Raw comment
===========

My main world editing tool is a server running WorldEdit and VoxelSniper.<br>
For my map making I use WorldPainter, and believe it or not I haven't touched MCEdit in months.<br>
As far as functionality goes I love VoxelSniper,<br>
while the commands get a little complicated it is such a powerful tool I can't complain.<br>
Where WorldPainter is concerned I like it, but as a Mac user the interface could be freshened up,<br>
and as an engineer I would like it to be more like a CAD program,<br>
better zooming in and out so things don't just get blurry, hold down middle click to pan,<br>
little things like that. I just wish there was an ignore editor with the simplicity of WorldPainter,<br>
but the functionality of VoxelSniper...
